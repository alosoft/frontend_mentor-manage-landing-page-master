## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

To be honest this took me longer than it should, I had a hard time positioning the background images and I also couldn't show the carousel indicators from owl.carousel.js (https://lnkd.in/eY7sfCv5).
